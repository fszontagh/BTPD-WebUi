*What is it?
-This is an other WebUi for the btpd daemon. (https://github.com/btpd/btpd)


This webui is based on the php-btpd project. (http://code.google.com/p/php-btpd/)



INSTALL

For installation, need 3 program for installed. 

1.: btpd 
2.: http server
3.: configured PHP


For http server, you can use the mongoose project, it can use php-cgi. For example in OpenSuse

$ zypper install php5-fastcgi php5-sockets

After the php installation, need collect the build dependencies for mongoose. Then download, and build it:

$ wget http://mongoose.googlecode.com/files/mongoose-3.0.tgz
$ tar xfv mongoose-3.0.tgz
$ cd mongose-3.0
$ make unix



You can start now mongoose with same paramteres:
$ ./mongoose -C .php -I /usr/bin/php-cgi -d no -i index.html -k yes -r /var/www/

And then, copy the webui files to the /var/www directory, and edit the config.php file.

Btpd for default, create a directory in the user's home directory for settings, and resume data with '.btpd' name.
In the config file of the webui, change the $DATA variable to these directory path. For example:
$DATA = "/home/username/.btpd";

The $DATA_DIR variable is the path, for the downloaded data's path. If you don't want to download to the .btpd/files/ path, specify an other directory for it. 
This directory must writeable for the btpd user. 

It's  better thing, if you use same user for the http, btpd, and the downloads.
